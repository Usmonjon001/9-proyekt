					<b class="bold">T</b>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep whithin everyone, even though most people don't take time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, setting for something much less than repect. I am convinded one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.

					I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra attention, or high regard, based on the desire to show them how highly they are valued.
